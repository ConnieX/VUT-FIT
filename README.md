# VUT-FIT
Projects from my studies on Brno University of Technology, Faculty of Informatics.

Files can contain parts of code created by instructors, such as provided structures or function names, typically for program structure restrictions.
Please do not use this solution for your projects at BUT FIT, as doing so could lead to disciplinary action and expulsion. However, feel free to read the code if you feel stuck or need inspiration (but remember to write your own code and avoid copying).
